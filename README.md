# House-price-prediction
The project aim is to predict the price of a house by its features.If you are a buyer or seller of the house but you don't know the exact price of the house,so supervised machine learning regression algorithms can help you to predict the price of the house just providing features of the target house.
# Project steps
# 1. Data Collection
The data is collected from a Kaggle-House-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.
# 2. Data Analysis
* Exploring the data and understanding the information of data and the null values in a datasets.
* exploring the null values using a seaborn heatmap.
* drop the columns which contains more than 20% null values.
# Handling missing values
1. Bsmt feature
2. Garage feature
3. LotFrontage feature
4. remaining features
# Feature transformation
converting the features which contains a categorical values.
# Training the model
Spliting the datasets into x_train,y_train,x_test and Training the model by using different algorithms:
1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Model
3. Lasso model
4. support vector machine
5. decision tree regression

By using the cross validation technique predictiong the score of each algorithm.

# The highest accuracy is 86%
